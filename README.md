## 💡 Overview

**Bookworm** is a responsive web application that helps users **track their reading progress** using data from the **Google Books API**. Users can search for books, organize them into shelves, set due dates, and view daily reading goals — all while keeping notes and ratings for future reference. All data is stored locally for persistence, and users can easily switch between light and dark themes.
